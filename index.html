          <li>Mark was born on February 29, 1976 in Holywood, Co. Down, Northern Ireland.</li>
          <li>At age 5 Mark lost the sight in his right eye and was forced to avoid contact sports for the remainder of his childhood to preserve the vision in his left eye.</li>
          <li>He was educated at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution where he was a keen rower. </li>
          <li> He later went on to study Business and Economics in Trinity College, Dublin, where he became a champion schools rower and captain of the university's rowing club but at age 22 he lost the sight in his left eye when his retina became detached and was left blind.</li>
          <li>This had a devastating effect on him as he believed at the time that blind people could not have a life which he perceived as normal – that they could not participate in sport, work, study, socialise or date.</li>
          <li>Before his operation he had been about to embark on a city job in London, UK but after it was left with no option but to return home to his mother.</li>
          <li>Pollock enrolled in a course to help come to terms with his disability. </li>

        <blockquote>"I just wanted to be independent again. I started to get the tools that might help me: my computer; my speaking clock; my watch; Larry, my guide dog.”</blockquote>
        
          <ul>
            <li>He returned to rowing and won bronze and silver medals for Northern Ireland in the 2002 Commonwealth Rowing Championships.</li>           
            <li>He engaged in other athletic pursuits, including running six marathons in seven days with a sighted partner across the Gobi Desert, China in 2003 when he raised tens of thousands of euro for the charity Sightsavers International.</li>
            <li>On 10 April 2004, he competed in the North Pole Arctic Marathon on the sixth anniversary of his blindness.</li>
            <li>In July 2010 Mark suffered a tragic fall from a second story window. He broke his back and was left paralysed. Mark is now living his own lessons, deciding how to overcome this second blow. A pioneer, he is exploring the frontiers of spinal cord injury recovery through aggressive physical therapy and robotic technology.</li>
            <li>Pollock has embarked on an ambitious experimental treatment in an effort to overcome his paralysis in cooperation with an innovative treatment centre in California called <a href="http://projectwalk.com/" target="_blank">Project Walk</a></li>
            <li>To mark the 10th anniversary of blindness Pollock explored the challenge of racing to the South Pole.</li>
            <li>In addition to an honorary degree awarded by Trinity College Dublin, Pollock has been awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Queen's University Belfast, and has been named a Young Global Leader.</li>
            <li>In 2012, Pollock was honored with a Rehab People of the Year Award.</li>
            <li>He has also written <a href="http://www.markpollock.com/">a book called "Making It Happen"</a>, detailing his struggles with sight-loss and experiences as a public speaker</li>
